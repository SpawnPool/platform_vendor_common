This section is the public repository for all Offical Build configuration manifests.

Builds are outlined by device or device-tree.  Calling these repos will add that
device/device-tree calls to the sync manifests.

These device/tree segments are moved to .repo/local_manifests and are imported when
repo sync is called.

These fragments are auto-enumerated and can be called by filename as arguments.

Every device tree call includes the base options.
