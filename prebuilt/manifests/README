This section is the public repository for all Offical Build configuration manifests.

The main "base" repos (access via the jet/repo.sh base command) is oct.xml 
and cm.xml.  

Builds are outlined by device or device-tree.  Calling these repos will add that
device/device-tree calls to the sync manifests.

These device/tree segments are stubbie manifest fragments.

Others will be added in without header or footer tag! (No <manifest> or <xml> tags!)

These fragments are auto-enumerated and can be called by filename as arguments.

Every device tree call includes the base options.
/********************************************************************************
/   Current Device Tree:
/   sam.xml = Samsung Device Tree             nex.xml = Nexus Device Tree
/   flo.xml = Nexus7 (2013)                   grouper.xml = Nexux7 (2012)
/

Be aware!  This will only give you what you ASK for as far as device tree, and nothing else!
